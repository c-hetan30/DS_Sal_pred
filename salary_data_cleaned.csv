Since our founding over 10 years ago, we’ve always been a different kind of company. After moving to New York from his native Turkey, our CEO Hamdi Ulukaya found that in America, yogurt just wasn’t as delicious or widely available as it was back home. He thought everyone deserved better options, so he set about making delicious, nutritious, natural, and accessible Greek Yogurt right here in the U.S.

Our mission since day one has been to provide better food to more people. And now as the No. 1-selling Greek Yogurt brand in America that is expanding beyond yogurt, we believe every food maker has a responsibility to provide people with better options, which is why we’re so proud of the way our food is made.

Our food philosophy of crafting quality products with simple ingredients is what sets Chobani apart. Our belief that business done right has the ability to change lives and strengthen communities is what sets our company apart. From the way we source our ingredients to how we treat our employees, Chobani strives to make universal wellness happen sooner with everything we do. Certified as a Great Place to Work®, our culture is built on shared passion, dedication, and a commitment to doing what is right.

QRI delivers the next-generation of augmented AI-based analytics and decision-making solutions to the oil and gas industry. Our business is growing rapidly, and we need a skilled business developer to acquire and manage new client relationships. The ideal candidate for the Senior Sales Engineer, ML and AI role will have deep experience in engineering to create demonstrable value in dollars and sense when selling our technology products. In this role, the Senior Sales Engineer will quickly appreciate QRI is not a traditional consultant or technology firm. We never have been. Our work does not end in a PowerPoint™, in software to train ML models, or to analyze declination curves. Our work, instead, inflects. And these inflections occur when the client has recognizably achieved real improvement in their stated processes, savings in CAPEX or OPEX, formation of more efficient protocols, more successful sales, and more beneficial evaluations— all of these brought to completion quickly and efficiently. These qualities, which are typical of engineers who have worked on real projects, are the vital attributes in effectively fulfilling the Senior Sales Engineer role. It does not matter if you have built or designed an oil refinery, a high-speed train line, a power line, or developed an oil field. The right Senior Sales Engineer profile is an engineer who knows what value creation is and knows what it is to create something that brings profitable impact to the company and ultimately to the customer.

Finally, in this role, you can expect to interface with people all day, every day. Moreover, to effectively interface with people and invite them to listen to you, invite you to meetings, or purchase our ML/AI products and services, your interpersonal skills will always remain a crucial component to winning.

In this role you will report and deliver to senior management at the firm.

The company offers salary plus commissions and bonuses for hitting sales goals.

Required Personal Qualities:
Loyal – You put the company’s objective first. You embrace free, selfless esprit de corps.
Curious – Leveraging intellectual excellence. Relentlessly learning about new industries & sectors. Prove it. You’re curious? Show us.
Technology focused – You love technology. You dream about it. You love it. And you know every detail about how our technology works and the value it brings to our clients.
Fiercely proactive – You don’t wait for the client to contact you. You don’t. You go out and greet, meet, engage, promote, and close.You have Stick-to-itiveness. You close: Close.
Business visionary – You rapidly scale our products since you’ve scaled before.You don’t stop at 100 just because the company asks for 20. You think and deliver exponentially: You go to 1,000 and beyond. Because that is you.
Problem solver – With our AI/ML technologies, you quickly establish how to save on costs for the client, increase sales and create value. You solve when they can’t. It’s what you do.
Strategic initiator – You have a strategy for approaching clients. It’s defined. And that strategy is in constant evolution with the market. When the market shifts, you can adapt.
Antifragile – You improve with stress, rather than merely resist it as the word ""resilient"" implies. You get stronger, quicker, smarter, wiser every time you encounter the word “no” or face push-back.
Socially smart– You possess a broad spectrum of social skills, speak thoughtfully, project your knowledge confidently, and have a good image, both on and off line. You’re sharp, on point, unafraid of combining ideas with ideas and working with your team toward a common goal.

Professional Experience:
Engineering or industrial experience.
Five plus years presenting technical pitches to executive audiences regularly.
You have worked across industries. You learn about them and their problem sets.
Ability to make high-quality presentations.

Help us build the AI-powered tutor that helps anyone learn anything.
Inspired by our belief that anyone can learn anything and powered by our own curiosity, we build the smartest tools we can imagine to help students learn. Quizlet is a personalized learning platform allowing students to create study questions, activities, and games or to access study sets created by teachers and other learners. Two-thirds of U.S. high school students and half of all college students the 1.5 billion students around the world already use Quizlet with 50 million students studying with us each month. , 2 million more sign up each month, and we’re on track to become the undisputed leader in user-generated learning content, at the scale of YouTube.

Now we’re building an AI-powered tutor that adapts and improves the more you use it. To serve our global community of learners, our teams tackle lofty technical challenges and design for use cases across cultures and languages. We work hard, act like owners, and collaborate every chance we get. We’re energized by the potential to power more learners and by the new lessons, we learn every day.

We’re looking for new team members who crave a challenge and want to help us continue amplifying our impact. If you’d like to learn more, reach out at careers@quizlet.com or visit our careers page .
Check Out The Blog!

About the team:

The Study team strives to help learners meet their study goals across all of our supported platforms. This includes improving upon core product features, researching better ways to practice and master the content in Quizlet, and looking for ways to improve our study modes like the ML adaptive Learn mode. Our current projects include modernizing the Study modes with shared core logic using Kotlin Multiplatform, expanding the data model to support new user experiences, and rearchitecting the way we store our user-generated data to support massive scalability.
As a cross-functional team, we have engineers from Android, iOS, and Web working together with members from Product, Design, Data Science, Data Analytics, Product Support, and Marketing, to improve and develop new learning experiences. We also work closely with user research to understand how people use our product and what’s getting in their way to practice and master whatever they are learning.
One of our recent mobile projects has been improving our Flashcards study mode experience by updating the design of the feature to a more intuitive swiping flow that allows users to make piles for what they know and don’t know. We’re currently working on a big leap in grading user’s written answers to semantically interpret their input and give them feedback on how well they understand conceptually.


A breakdown of the average day in this role:

As a Senior Android Engineer, an average day likely starts by sharing your daily progress status with your team in Slack on what you accomplished yesterday, what you hope to accomplish today, and anything that is getting in your way or in the way of the team, then meet with team and huddle together to discuss progress towards our sprint goals around 10 AM PT.
At the beginning of the sprint, you’ll meet with the team to plan the sprint and discuss what goals the team can accomplish in the sprint and what will need to be done to accomplish them. Similarly, at the end of the sprint, you’ll meet for a team retrospective to discuss what has gone well and what could be improved in our sprint process.
Typically, the team aims to schedule meetings between 10 am and 2 pm, so that you have blocks of uninterrupted time in the morning and the afternoon to focus.
During the uninterrupted time, typically you get deep into coding and building the things you researched and estimated. You can also use that time to research a project and identify what will need to be groomed with the product manager, or what you questions you need to ask the designer, or how does the project need to be structured to work with our data along a data scientist, or what specific events will the data analyst need to answer our experiment hypothesis.
This research allows you to understand the product requirements and create Jira issues to later estimate with a larger group of Android engineers to ensure your approach is sound and others are familiar with your decisions, and ultimately to help you estimate the work so it can be later scheduled into a sprint. Once you code the feature and build the tests to ensure it works as designed, you create a pull request where you can help other engineers learn how you built the new feature or fixed a defect, and get feedback to grow as a developer.
Outside the team process and meetings, the Android team also meets biweekly and discusses upcoming projects and progress being made on the platform from the other teams with Android engineers.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box.
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
