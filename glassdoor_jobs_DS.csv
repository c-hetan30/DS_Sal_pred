Since our founding over 10 years ago, we’ve always been a different kind of company. After moving to New York from his native Turkey, our CEO Hamdi Ulukaya found that in America, yogurt just wasn’t as delicious or widely available as it was back home. He thought everyone deserved better options, so he set about making delicious, nutritious, natural, and accessible Greek Yogurt right here in the U.S.

Our mission since day one has been to provide better food to more people. And now as the No. 1-selling Greek Yogurt brand in America that is expanding beyond yogurt, we believe every food maker has a responsibility to provide people with better options, which is why we’re so proud of the way our food is made.

Our food philosophy of crafting quality products with simple ingredients is what sets Chobani apart. Our belief that business done right has the ability to change lives and strengthen communities is what sets our company apart. From the way we source our ingredients to how we treat our employees, Chobani strives to make universal wellness happen sooner with everything we do. Certified as a Great Place to Work®, our culture is built on shared passion, dedication, and a commitment to doing what is right. Together, the Chobani family has created something unlike what any company has done before. The possibilities are endless.

The Signal Processing Group at MERL conducts research that encompasses a wide range of work in the areas of sensing, estimation, localization, inverse problems, sparse reconstruction, array signal processing, and communications. Within the Signal Processing Group the Computational Sensing Team explores novel approaches for signal acquisition and sensing, methods to filter and recover signals in the presence of noise and other degrading factors, and techniques that infer meaning from the processed signals and fusing signals from multiple sensing modalities.

At MERL, researchers have wide latitude to set their own path and pursue their passions. We are proud to foster an environment that values both fundamental scientific contributions and their application to real business. MERL provides a unique level of freedom and flexibility among industrial research labs.

As a member of our staff, you will be identifying new problems and solutions that have broad application and are fundamentally useful both in the field of signal processing and for the parent company.
